# Hatfield Junior Swimming School (HJSS) Website Project 

# Frontend Development Task 
## Project Overview

## School Information 
The Hatfield Junior Swimming School offers swimming lessons at Grades 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

The school has 3-4 coaches who can teach at all grade levels. Learners are aged between 4 
and 11, with grade levels from 0 to 5 (0 means new to swimming).
